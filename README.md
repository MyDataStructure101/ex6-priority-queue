# Exercise 6

1. Exercise 1: 
- Implementing the displayQueue Method Implement a method called displayQueue in the PriorityQueue class that prints all the elements in the queue from front to back, without modifying the queue. 
- This will help you to understand how to traverse linked lists.

2. Exercise 2: 
- Implementing Priority with Separate Priority Field Modify the Node class to include a separate priority field, and adjust the enqueue function to insert based on this priority instead of the node's data value. 
- This more accurately reflects real-world uses of priority queues where the data and its priority may differ.
